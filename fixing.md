The error message you're seeing suggests a file permission issue. When Docker containers run, they execute processes as a specific user. If the user running the process in the container doesn't have the necessary permissions to access a certain file, you'll encounter a permission error, like the one you're seeing.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check Host Permissions**: Check the permissions of `vite.config.js` on your host machine.
   ```bash
   ls -l path/to/your/vite.config.js
   ```
   This will show you the permissions and the owner of the file.

2. **Use a Dockerfile**: If you're not already using one, consider using a Dockerfile for your frontend service. In this Dockerfile, you can adjust the permissions of the files before they're used. For example:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:latest

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY . .

   # Adjust permissions
   RUN chown -R node:node /app

   ...
   ```

   Here, we change the ownership of everything in `/app` to the `node` user, which is a default non-root user present in official Node.js Docker images.

3. **Adjust `user` in `docker-compose.yml`**: If you know the user ID and group ID of the user you wish to run the process as, you can adjust the `user` field in `docker-compose.yml`. For example:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     frontend:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       user: "1000:1000"
   ```

   In this example, `1000:1000` is the user ID and group ID, respectively. You can find the user and group IDs of the current user on your host machine by running `id -u` for the user ID and `id -g` for the group ID.

4. **Explicitly Change Permissions**: As a less elegant workaround, you can forcefully change the permissions of the problematic file from within the `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     frontend:
       command: sh -c "chmod 777 /app/vite.config.js && npm run serve"
   ```

   This is a quick fix and might not be secure depending on your use case, but it can help in local development environments.

5. **Volumes**: If you're using volumes to mount your code into the container, ensure that the volume paths are correct, and consider the implications of mounting host directories into a container, especially regarding file ownership and permissions. Using named volumes or copying the code into the image might give you more predictable results.

6. **Check Vite Configuration**: It's also worth ensuring that nothing in your Vite configuration (or related scripts) is attempting to change file permissions or ownership in a way that would cause this issue.

7. **Docker User Namespaces**: If you have Docker user namespaces enabled, this can also affect file permissions. If this feature is enabled, you might need to adjust your setup accordingly.

8. **Logs and Debugging**: Consider adding more verbose logging or debugging to your frontend application or script to get more detailed information about what it's attempting to do when it encounters the error.

One or more of the above suggestions should help you resolve the issue. If you're still having trouble after trying them, you might need to look deeper into your application and Docker setup for other potential causes.

The error message you've provided indicates a permission issue with the `vite.config.js` file in your container. The Dockerfile seems mostly correct with respect to handling permissions, especially with the `--chown=node:node` directive during the copy commands.

However, several common factors can cause this issue:

1. **File Permission on Host**: Before building the Docker image, ensure that the `vite.config.js` file has appropriate permissions on your host machine. Sometimes, the permissions on the host can influence the permissions inside the container.

    On your host machine, run:
    ```bash
    chmod +r vite.config.js
    ```

2. **Nested Directories**: If `vite.config.js` is inside nested directories, you might want to ensure that all parent directories also have appropriate permissions.

3. **Volumes**: If you're mounting a volume to `/app` when you run the container, that could be replacing your directory inside the container with what's on your host, which can be a common source of permission issues. Ensure that the volume's contents on the host machine are accessible to the `node` user in the container.

4. **Docker Cache**: Docker caches layers to improve build times. Sometimes, the cache might have stale or incorrect data. To ensure you're building with fresh layers, use the `--no-cache` option when building your image:
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t your_image_name .
    ```

5. **Base Image**: While rare, there could be changes or issues with the base image you're using. It's worth checking if there are any known issues with the specific version of the base image or updating to the latest one.

6. **Docker Daemon User**: If your Docker daemon runs as a different user (other than root), there could be permission issues, especially if using Docker in certain environments or platforms. This is less common but worth checking if you've exhausted other options.

If after checking and/or implementing the above suggestions the problem persists, consider providing additional details about the environment you're running this in, such as the OS, Docker version, and any specific details about the directory structure and permissions.
